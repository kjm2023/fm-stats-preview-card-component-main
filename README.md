## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project afforded me the opportunity to explore a different way of sharing images (mobile image versus desktop image).

### Continued development

I would love to explore images and image loading options for mobile versus desktop. Any helpful resources or advice are more than welcomed. I am also interested in getting an image that is not a background image to truly grow with the container. I ended up with a new 'design' between viewports.

### Useful resources

- [Mix Blend Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - Blend modes are everything. Who knew we had Photoshop options on the web!
- [Prevent Images from Shrinking with Flex Box](https://befused.com/css/flexbox-prevent-image-shrinking/) - This truly helped with the sizing.
